## About Me

I am the James B. Duke Assistant Professor of the Practice in Data Science at Davidson College. I am a Cabarrus County native, having been born, raised, and educated in Concord. I attended Beverly Hills Elementary, Concord Middle, and Concord High before beginning my undergraduate studies at Davidson in 2003. I grew up in the First Presbyterian Church of Concord and gave back to my community as a member of BSA Troop 3 and the Tarheel Keystone Club.

My wife, Megan, was also born, raised, and educated in Cabarrus County, having graduated from Northwest Cabarrus HS before attending UNC Chapel Hill. We bought our first home together in Concord in 2016. This county is part of our DNA.

I believe in the adage "think global, act local." As a data science educator, I have access to tools and skills that I know can benefit the people of Cabarrus County, and that's what this project aims to do.
